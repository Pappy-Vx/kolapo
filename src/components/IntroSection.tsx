        From curiosity to code, from ideas to impact my journey in software
        engineering is fueled by a passion for building solutions that donâ€™t
        just work but work brilliantly. Early on, I realized that writing code
        is only part of the equation. What truly makes a difference? Engineering
        for efficiency, optimizing resources, and solving real-world problems
        with scalable, high-performance solutions.
